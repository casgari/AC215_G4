Diffusion models are a class of machine learning models that have gained significant attention in recent times for their ability to generate high-quality samples from complex data distributions. At their core, diffusion models operate by simulating a random process known as diffusion, which can be thought of as the reverse of a denoising process. Starting with a random noise sample, the model iteratively refines the sample through a series of steps, gradually morphing the noise into a sample that closely resembles the target data distribution. This is achieved by leveraging a sequence of transition probabilities, which guide the diffusion process. One of the primary advantages of diffusion models is their ability to generate samples without the need for explicit likelihood computation, which is a common requirement in many generative models. Their flexibility and robustness have led to applications in a variety of domains, from image synthesis to audio generation. As research progresses, the potential of diffusion models continues to unfold, promising even more advanced and diverse applications in the future.
