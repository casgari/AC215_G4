 So I'm going to go ahead and run this code. And now I am going to go ahead and write the neural network. So I'm just going to write class. Let's see if this works or not. There we go. So you'll see that this is actually basically just writing our entire neural network for us. So this is actually fancier than what I was going for. This is actually using a convolutional neural network, which we haven't really talked about.
